#### Scenario: 
Assessed the effect that changing the poverty cutoff line could have on welfare distribution. 
#### Method:
The hypothesis was that changing the poverty cutoff line will have an effect on welfare distribution. Gathered data for my research from the Current Population Survey released for March of 2018 from the U.S. Census Bureau and cleaned the data to include the relevant fields that I was looking to analyze. Created an OLS regression model with the statistical software Stata. For my OLS regression model, the Poverty Line Cutoff was the independent variable and the Welfare Income Received was the dependent variable. The control variables (variables that can have an effect on the dependent variable that are not the independent variable being tested) were Total Family Income, Family Size, Employment Status, and Disability Status. 
#### Quick Summary of Results
The poverty line cutoff did have a statistically significant impact on the amount of welfare one would receive, in this case, the regression model estimated that increasing the poverty cutoff line would increase the amount of welfare one would receive. One factor that was worth noting however was that the Disability Status control variable actually had a major impact on whether someone would need welfare or not, with those that was disabled in the regression model estimated to receive approximately $1079 more in welfare income than someone that did not have a disability.
